            <h2>About Me!</h2>
            <p>This website was made by a nerdy and bored high school student. I spend most of my time programming and learning. Inside and outside of school.</p>
            <p>My hobbies are music production and programming.</p>
            <p>I used to play Minecraft and other games, but I don't play very many games anymore.</p>
            <p>I love Arch Linux. I am a huge privacy nerd, and just like a nerd in general. Or at least that's what my friends tell me.</p>
            <p>I'm thinking about working in cybersecurity or web development. I might start a IT business though.</p>
            <p>Some other things about me</p>
            <ul>
                <li>My favorite color is pink (if you couldn't tell already)</li>
                <li>My favoirte pet are cats. I love Tortoiseshell cats.</li>
                <li>I am bisexual, and support all of LQBTQIA+ 🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍⚧️</li>
                <li>My favorite instrument is the acoustic guitar</li>
                <li>I am big on lofi music (I fucking love narpy), hip-hop & rap, and indie music.</li>

            <h2>About this website!</h2>
            <p>I've had this website for almost a year. Been hosted on places like InfinityFree and Github. Been mostly hosted on Github.</p>
            <p>I have all the code on Github currently. My domain was also provied partially by Github.</p>
            <p>I am a student, so I took advantage of the Github Education Pack and NameCheap gave me a free domain for being a student.</p>
            <p>The domain is protected and managed by Cloudflare.</p>
            <p>Cloudflare also builds and publishes my website. I use the Cloudflare Pages feature in Cloudflare to deploy my website</p>
