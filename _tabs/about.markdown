i'm a high school student who like to program and write stuff. i've made many websites and other things. 

i don't quite know my sexuality and things yet, [but i did fall in love with this girl!!](https://blogspace.jackpurrin.me/posts/love/) 

i play a lot of minecraft and half-life but my free time is usually spent on github, or random websites such as uquiz. 

what do you listen to? i don't quite know. 

i do listen to some hip hop and rap, but then i listen to stuff like frank sinatra one day. or some indie stuff. i love mac demarco! 

i want to work on a useless web clone.
