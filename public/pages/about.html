                <h2>about</h2>
                <h3>me</h3>
                <p>i was born and raised in arizona, where i spent a majority of my time learning and being a genrally curious person. in elementary i loved going to school, a way for me to learn more and more to feed my curious mind. i used to love doing experiments relating to electricty with my dad. it was super fun. one thing lead to another and that lead to me being curious about the computer. i kept learning thing after thing that made me who i am right now! i loved to learn all sorts of programming and learn about the deep parts of the computer. hardware and software level. </p>
                <p>if someone were to describe me right now, they would say i am a curious and smart person. i stay quiet but that does not stop me from being helpful! i'm caring, and i put a lot of effort into things i love.</p>
                <p>not all the things people can use to describe me are good though. i'm always tired and sleepy, and barely happy. but i'm working on it, maybe i'll be better soon.</p>
                <p> i have a big passion for cybersecurity and IT related things. i want to evantually open up my own computer repair store and for a job i want to persure cybersecurity.</p>
                <p>some other things about me:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>my favorite color is pink</li>
                    <li>i love cats.</li>
                    <li>my favorite instrument is the guitar</li>

                    <li>and i use arch linux, btw.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>this website</h3>
                <p> it all began at around the end of my 8th grade year. (4/20/24) i had passion for web development before then but never actually got to work and made a website. mostly due to me not having a proper domain, i just didn't have the money for it. after a while, i found infinityfree. i don't reccomend it unless you are really desperate, it's got tons of tracking and it felt like shit to use. it gave me a .rf.gd domain, which i was fine with. at the time, i just wanted something sort and simple to work with. the website took off and it was way bare bones. i didn't know much about html, css and i did not know any javascript. it was poorly coded, with inline this after that and so forth. but that didnt stop me from having a website and having fun!</p>
                <p> i knew one of my mom's co-workers. he was super chill and really wanted me to learn and learn and learn! he told me about the github student developer pack. it's awesome and i totally reccomend checking it out! once 9th grade hit i actually got a real domain (the one your on right now) and my website was open source for the first time. here i learned more and more and more css and javascript. next iternation over the other and so much time spent. i'd bet i've spent over 200 hours working on websites!</p>
                <p> i used to host my website on github pages and it was okay. i had github on my phone when i used to host it and i got constant notifications that my builds had failed and i had no clue why. i'd reccomend github pages if you just want everything in one spot. currently though, i use cloudflare pages. i love it so much! it works so well and i don't really have any major complaints about it. </p>
